# InsightEdit: Towards Better Instruction Following for Image Editing
## Overview
This repository contains the official implementaion of our InsightEdit. In this work, we first curated the AdvancedEdit dataset using a novel data construction pipeline, formulating a large-scale dataset with high visual quality, complex instructions, and good background consistency. 
Then, to further inject the rich image information, we introduce a two-stream bridging mechanism utilizing both the textual and visual features reasoned by the powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to guide the image editing process more precisely.
