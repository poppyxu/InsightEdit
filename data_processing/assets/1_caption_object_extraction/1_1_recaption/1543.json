    "caption": "A bearded man with a red headband and sunglasses is seated on a large rock, strumming a grey acoustic guitar. He is dressed in a blue short-sleeved shirt, dark jeans, and black shoes. The setting is outdoors, with a panoramic view of a winding river surrounded by lush greenery and distant mountains under a dramatic cloudy sky. The man appears to be enjoying a serene moment, immersed in his music, with the natural beauty of the landscape stretching out before him. The lighting suggests it could be late afternoon or early evening, with the sun casting a warm glow over the scene.",
